<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Processors with multiple cores opens up for better utilisation of hardware resources for applications if they take advantage of concurrency and parallelism. There are several methods to reap the benefits of concurrency; software transactional memory, actors and agents, locks and threads. The use of parallelism in programming comes at a price: synchronisation between threads operating on shared memory resources.
<br/><br/>
New software libraries and programming language exists to simplify implementation of parallel application and this essay investigate strategies on those with the Java Virtual Machine as a commonon denominator: Java, Clojure and Groovy.
